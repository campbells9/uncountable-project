My submission for the Uncountable Take-home Frontend Assignment. It uses plain
Javascript, Bootstrap, and [Plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/).

My project runs entirely the browser. Clone the project and open
```index.html``` in a browser with Javascript enabled to run.

Total time:
* Plots and selecting experiment: 90 minutes
* Search: 60 minutes
* Misc: 20 minutes
